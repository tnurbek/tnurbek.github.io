<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am Nurbek Tastan, currently pursuing a <b>Doctor of Philosophy</b> degree in Machine Learning. I am associated with the [SPriNT-AI lab](https://www.sprintai.org/) at MBZUAI, where I conduct my research under the guidance of my supervisor, Dr. Karthik Nandakumar. With over three years of professional experience as a Data Scientist, I possess a comprehensive knowledge of the modern machine learning pipeline and strong mathematical and probabilistic thinking skills. I specialize in modeling complex machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and optimization algorithms. My research primarily focuses on the areas of federated learning and ensuring the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence.
