I am Nurbek Tastan, currently pursuing a <b>Doctor of Philosophy</b> degree in Machine Learning. I am associated with the [SPriNT-AI lab](https://www.sprintai.org/) at MBZUAI, where I conduct my research under the guidance of my supervisor, [Dr. Karthik Nandakumar](https://www.sprintai.org/nkarthik). With over four years of professional experience as a machine learning researcher, I possess a comprehensive knowledge of the modern machine learning pipeline and strong mathematical and probabilistic thinking skills. I specialize in modeling complex machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and distributed optimization algorithms. My research primarily focuses on the areas of <b>federated learning</b> and ensuring the <b>trustworthiness</b> of artificial intelligence systems.
